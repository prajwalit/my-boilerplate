      <h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
      <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by
        English philologist and University of Oxford professor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>. The
        story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy
        novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger
        work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it
        during World War II. It is the third best-selling novel ever
        written, with over 150 million copies sold.</p>
      <p>The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist,
        the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created
        the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate
        weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of
        Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a Hobbit land
        not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across
        north-west Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the
        Ring through the eyes of its characters, notably the hobbits Frodo
        Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and
        Peregrin "Pippin" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and
        travelling companions: Aragorn, a Human Ranger; Boromir, a man
        from Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas, an Elven prince; and
        Gandalf, a Wizard.</p>
